# ObjectCallbacks

I needed something similar to BeforeFilters [**https://github.com/IDme/before_filters**] but more than that.

This library allow you to bind before_call and after_call to a Ruby class method, similar to ActiveRecord's callbacks.

Similar to ActiveRecord, if you need to termiate execution in before_call just return false.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'object_callbacks'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install object_callbacks

## Usage

```ruby
class MyClass
  extend ObjectCallbacks

  before_call :sit_down
  before_call :drink_one_glass,    only: [:sleep]
  after_call  :drink_four_glasses, only: [:wake_up]

  def sleep
    puts 'Go to sleep'
  end

  def wake_up
    puts 'Get up now'
  end

  private

  def drink_one_glass
    puts 'Drink one glass'
  end

  def drink_four_glasses
    puts 'Drink four glasses'
  end

  def sit_down
    puts 'Please sit down'
  end
end

my_class = MyClass.new

my_class.sleep
=> Please sit down
=> Drink one glass
=> Go to sleep

```
